Clone the repo:

```

Change directory into repo:
```
cd CourseBin
```

Switch to the appropriate branch:
```
git checkout basic-project-prototype-2
```

Install the required root node modules:
```
yarn install
```

Change directory into the client folder:
```
cd client
```

Install the required client node modules:
```
yarn install
```

Change back into the root directory:
```

```

Create a new file `.env` in the root directory and add the necessary stuff (See Basecamp Docs & Files):
